Destructuring { completed, ...rest }

This pulls the completed property out into a variable named completed.

...rest collects the remaining properties (userId, id, title) into an object called rest.

Return value ({ ...rest, done: completed })

We spread rest into a new object (so we keep userId, id, title).

We then add done: completed, which creates the new done property with the same value as completed.

Because we did not include completed when spreading rest, the resulting object has no completed propertyâ€”only done
